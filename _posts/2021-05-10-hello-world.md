So here we are. I used up all of my frontend skills to bring to you this blog. It's been a fun challenge to get this
thing up and running, but I think this is where the _real_ challenge starts.

I'm not a writer by any means, but I've noticed that I do a lot of thinking while writing (mainly documentation at 
work). I really like how writing things down help me articulate and develop my thoughts, while making learnings stick. 
Oh, and the whole added bonus that stuff is actually written down, so that I can review it later!

As describing yourself by exclusions of traits is quite a roundabout way of making an introduction, I'll just switch
tactics here: I'm Alexander Häger, thanks for reading this far! Currently, I'm employed at Spotify as a backend/data
engineer in the search team, where I mainly keep our Elasticsearch clusters and corresponding ingestion jobs happy. The
information retrieval field is something that kind of just happened to me, but I've been enjoying it a lot! I hope to be
able to publish some content on how we do search at Spotify in the future. In normal times I'd work out of our 
Stockholm office, but since the pandemic started I've been working from my home in Nyköping.

I also hack around a little bit on my spare time, mostly in Python. I have some projects that I've been meaning to make
public in some shape or form. A CLI tool for Elasticsearch is at the top of the list, but also some content on how I've
set up some web scraping on Google Cloud for super cheap. I'd like to get into some home automation also (which I have 
no experience in!). As you might've noticed by now, this blog will be mainly tech focused... I think. We'll see.
