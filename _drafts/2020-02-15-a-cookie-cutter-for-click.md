When working on the `es` CLI tool I wrote about earlier, it strook me that a lot of the things I created was probably 
pretty generic but more fully featured functionality for a CLI. So I made a cookie cutter out of it!

# Stuff every CLI needs

Here are some things I added to this cookie cutter that I think most CLIs benefit from:

- Logging setup
    - Log level flags
    - Log directory
- Something else
- And some more

Here's the code for the thingy-thingy:

```python
counter = 1
print(counter)  # Can't be sure enough... 
```
