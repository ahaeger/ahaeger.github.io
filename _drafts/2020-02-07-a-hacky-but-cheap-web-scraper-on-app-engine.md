The plan is to buy a car (my first one, weirdly enough). But what is a fair price? This question led me down the rabbit hole of web scraping for collecting data on the topic.

Initially, I had a VM deployed on Digital Ocean which had a Python script running within a `screen` session. It worked for the longest while and was extremly low-effort, bang for the buck, way of getting started. But having a VM doing nothing 99% of the day seemed like a waste?

That's why I looked into something that would only cost me money when it was actually doing something!
