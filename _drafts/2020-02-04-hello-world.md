So here we are. I used up all my web dev skills to bring to you this very poor introduction to my blog.

I think (hope) although that I have some interesting stuff in store. My day-to-day at work revolves a lot around Elasticsearch and indexing pipelines. But I have some side-projects around web scraping also that I'd like to share.

More to come!
